# HorseRaceSimulator
A simple horse race game made for the Object Oriented Programming Module. There is a textual version with basic features and a more advanced GUI version of the horse race that includes betting, displaying statistics, accessories and more.

No dependencies are needed for this project.

To run the textual version:
  - Goto the Part1 folder and in the command line, write:
      - javac Main.java (to compile the java files)
      - java Main (to run the file, java Main.java will also work)
      - Note: Main simply executes Race.startRace();

Similarly for the graphical version:
  - Goto the Part2 folder and in the command line, write:
    - javac Main.java
    - java Main
    - Note: Main simply executes Race.startRaceGUI() which utilises all the other GUI classes created

This was created using the IntelliJ Ide, but you can use any ide to configure.

Have fun played and would be much appreciated for any contributions!
